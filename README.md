# global-terrorism-analysis
In this work, I present analytical results obtained by data mining on the START
(Study of Terrorism and Response to Terrorism) dataset. The main objective is to visualize
terrorism data and make it available to users in an easy to understand format.


I would like to thank AlmaBetter for giving me this opportunity to work on this
project and enhance my learning and knowledge in the field of data mining
